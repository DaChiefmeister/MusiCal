        <img src="img/ocac.jpg" class="venuepic" alt="band at oxford community arts center">
        <p>Oxford Community Arts group was formed in 1998. Community need for an arts facility had long been identified, and   Miami University was about to dispose of the large, historic building that was once Oxford College for Women. A group of 12 formed a steering committee to save the building as a center for the arts in our area. The group was incorporated in 2001.</p>

        <p>The Mission of the Oxford Community Arts Center (OCAC) is to ENRICH lives and build community by providing, celebrating and promoting a diverse array of cultural and arts programming, performances and exhibits; carefully PRESERVE the historic Oxford College building and campus as a welcoming  environment offering classroom, studio, rehearsal, concert, theatre and meeting spaces; and ENSURE the Center’s ability to serve future generations as a catalyst, connector and magnet for emerging and established artists, performers, students, visitors and arts organizations.</p>

        <img src="img/matineemusicale.jpg" class="venuepic" alt="girl singing at matinee musicale">
        <p>The Matinée Musicale Club began in 1911 when a group of Cincinnati women, all performing musicians, joined forces to present five public concerts that year and in 1912. In 1913 the club launched the Matinée Musicale Recital Series, engaging professional musicians from around the world.</p>

        <p>Today Matinée Musicale Cincinnati is made up of active, professional and retired musicians, music teachers and other musical enthusiasts. For more than 100 seasons, these dedicated members have sustained a standard of musical excellence established by the club’s founders.</p>

        <p>Matinée Musicale has played an important role in Cincinnati’s musical history. Thanks to the club’s efforts, the city, widely acknowledged as fertile ground for the performing arts, especially classical music, saw early performances by numerous instrumentalists and vocalists who became classical music stars.</p>
